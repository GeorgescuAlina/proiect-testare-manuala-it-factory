# Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application. 

Application under test: https://demo.opencart.com/ 

Application documentation: http://docs.opencart.com/en-gb/introduction/

API Documentation: https://docs.opencart.com/en-gb/system/users/api/

**The final project will be split into 2 sections: [Testing section](https://github.com/julai215/itf_final_project_example_and_portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/README.md#1-testing-section) and [SQL section](https://github.com/julai215/itf_final_project_example_and_portofolio/blob/main/Final%20Project/README.md#2-sql-section).**

# Functional specifications

-> enter here the functional specifications created in JIRA


# 1 Testing section

## 1.1 Test Planning

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the NEW graphic interface of OpenCart application.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.

#### 1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated

| Job Title  | Number of employees |
| :---: | :---: |
| Project Manager  | 1  |
| Product Owner  | 1 |
|Senior Lead Promgrammer| 1|
|Middle Programmers| 2|
|User experience/ User Interface Designer| 1|
|QA Lead| 1|
|Manuela Tester| 1|

#### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined

* The website feature is partial/fully implemented
* Requirements and specifications are written and approved 
* When persons are allocated on their roles
* Required hardware (e.g. computers, mobiles etc)
* A designated space to work
* The manual tests are written based on application documentation

#### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined

* All manual tests are executed
* At least 90% of manual test are passed 
* The unresoled defects have low priority
* All defects have been re-tested and confirmed as fixed

#### 1.1.4 Test scope

* __Tests in scope:__ All the features related to the NEW graphic interface of OpenCart application - which were defined in software requirement specs need to be tested: functional testing, graphic user interface testing
* __Tests not in scope:__ compatibility testing with multiple browsers/ devices, existing functionalities implemented before, performance

#### 1.1.5 Risks detected

Project risks: 

* Insufficient budget to finalize the project
* Insufficient employees
* Lack of experience for the employees to finalize the project
* It might be not enought time to finalize the project at deadline

Product risks: 

* The NEW graphic user interface is not suitable for the existing users
* The graphic user interface is not fully funtional
* There should be no better competitors
* New browsers might not be supported


#### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue. 

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test. It will include:

* Test Coverage Metric
* Test Execution Metrics (Number of test cases pass, fail, blocked, on hold)
* Defect Metrics


#### Regarding Test Control, we will:

* Prioritizing the testing efforts
* Reorganizing the test environment
* Re-prioritizing the test cases

## 1.3 Test Analysis

The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the Dependents module. The following test conditions were found:

## 1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases 
are:
